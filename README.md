# About
This Anki card template is built to be easy to use, beautifully consistent and feature-complete. While there are many templates out there, not many, if any, tried to engineer in a UI/UX experience that feels natively built-in.

Here are some key features:
- Dark and Light Mode support
- System fonts for a native feel
- Furigana and Japanese text support (with correct typographic scale)
- Desktop UI buttons for common tasks
- Variable accent color based on subject names
- Code highlighting
- Accent color matches native Anki flag colors
- Subtle animations for answer reveals
- Near 'native' styling where possible, e.g., Material 3 color palette for Android
  
This card template was mainly produced and used on Mac and Android (Pixel). For any design or functionality tweaks on other platforms, such as Windows or Unix, please let me know.

This setup also avoids the bloat of excessive add-ons, but encourages using select add-ons where they genuinely enhance the card creation experience. Essentially, a somewhat vanilla experience wrapped with a thoughtful framework.

# Quick Start
Download the `.apkg` file from the Releases page, and it will import the two card types (Q&A, Cloze types) for you to use right away*

To download all the add-ons at once (including the recommended add-ons below), copy and paste this into your Anki Add-on menu:

```
1490471827 511710206 1844938046
```
*Note, the Undo and Flag status buttons won't work until you download the UI status buttons add-on.

## Recommended add-ons

### 1. UI Status Buttons
To use the UI buttons (Undo, Flag buttons) on Desktop, you'll need to download the add-on either from AnkiWeb, or within the Releases page.

### 2. Anki JavaScript API
addon: `1490471827` 
This is also a necessary add-on if you want to see how many remaining cards are in your deck during Card Review.

### 3. Field AutoComplete
addon: `511710206` If you find yourself often creating cards for the same topic, this is a lifesaver.

Used alongside the native pin function, you save 1+ minute per card.

### 4. Markdown support for code blocks and inline code
addon: `1844938046` If you need to use code blocks repeatedly, get this. 

It enables you to use double ticks for inline-code, `, and triple ticks for multi-line code blocks ts  with optional language support, i.e. ts for typescript, rs for rust, etc.
